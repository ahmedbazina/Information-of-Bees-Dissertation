# Information of Bees Dissertation
## About the Project
The purpose of this project is to analyse the data from Kaggle and build a predictive algorithm which would predict relevant parameter that beekeepers need such as weight increase based on temperature, humidity and flow.
The project aims to find a cost effective and sustainable choices for beekeepers to better manage their apiaries with minimal colony loss by embedding IoT sensors and machine learning into the hives to predict few factors that beekeepers spend most of their time analysing. 

Therefore, the main aim is to outline and plan what beekeepers need, what information/data is important to them, is there any tools that can aid them while remaining cost effective and efficient. These are some of the many areas researched and findings documented, in addition to, understanding data that has been collected from two hives in Germany from 2017 until 2019, this further enhanced the scope of research problem and aided in having an initial deep understanding of the factors that affect bees.



### Project Abstract
This research is exploring the advantages beekeeper’s usage of Internet of Things or more accurately Internet of Bees, since prior contributions are focusing on data collection and user needs, the approach to focus on user understanding and simplification of data through the utilization of sensors in the beekeeping field.
This research explains what beekeepers as users would benefit from the use of Internet of Things and the value they could gain from such sensors.
